# ShinyApp-Radial kernel Support vector Classifier


It is a Shiny web application made in R , which explains and demonstrates the effects of the hyperparameters such as __Regularization parameter-C__ and the __Gamma__ on the perfomance of the Radial kernel support vector classifier. It reactively plots the non linear decision boundary as we change the number of data points , shift between the classes or the hyperparameter values. 

The complete app is made in R using a application package called ShinyR which helps us to develop dynamic web based applications with designing UI to serving the application within R itself.
